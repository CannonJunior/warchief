# Alpha Bowl - 3D Football Game with AI-Powered NPCs

A real-time 3D American Football RPG game built with Flutter and Dart featuring AI-powered NPCs using local LLMs (Ollama + Model Context Protocol).

## Features

- **WoW-Inspired Controls**: WASD movement, mouse camera, rebindable keys
- **AI-Powered NPCs**: Control companions with high-level intent or direct commands
- **Local LLM Integration**: Ollama + MCP for privacy-focused AI
- **Asset-Based UI**: Easy SVG/PNG asset replacement with hot-reload
- **Web-First Development**: Fast iteration on port 8008

## Quick Start

### Prerequisites

```bash
# Install Flutter (if not installed)
# Visit: https://docs.flutter.dev/get-started/install

# Install Ollama (for AI features, optional for now)
curl -fsSL https://ollama.com/install.sh | sh

# Pull recommended models (optional)
ollama pull llama3.1:8b-instruct-q8_0
```

### Running the Game

```bash
# Simple: Use the start script
./start.sh

# Or manually:
cd alpha_bowl_game
flutter run -d web-server --web-port=8008 --web-hostname=localhost
```

Then open your browser to: **http://localhost:8008**
