# Phase 1 Complete! ðŸŽ‰

## Warchief 3D Isometric Game - Core Infrastructure

**Completion Date**: 2025-10-29
**Status**: âœ… FULLY PLAYABLE
**Server**: http://localhost:8008

---

## What Was Built

Phase 1 delivered a complete, playable game foundation with all core systems working together:

### âœ… 1. Input System
**Files**: `lib/models/game_action.dart`, `lib/game/controllers/input_manager.dart`

- **GameAction enum** - 30+ bindable actions (movement, action bars, pet controls, UI)
- **InputManager class** - Complete keybind management system
  - Continuous callbacks (WASD movement - called every frame while held)
  - One-time callbacks (Space jump - triggered once on press)
  - Key rebinding support (ready for UI integration)
  - Pressed key tracking
  - Default keybindings for all actions

**Key Features:**
- All WoW-inspired controls bound and ready
- Rebindable key system (infrastructure complete)
- Clean separation between actions and keys
- Easy to extend for new actions

---

### âœ… 2. Player Character
**File**: `lib/game/components/player_character.dart`

- **Full WASD movement** with velocity-based physics
- **Q/E rotation** - Smooth character rotation
- **Space to jump** - With scale animation
- **Boundary enforcement** - Player stays within map bounds
- **Health tracking** - Ready for combat system
- **Visual representation** - Blue circle with direction indicator

**Movement System:**
- Forward/backward movement relative to rotation
- Strafe left/right perpendicular to facing
- Smooth rotation with configurable speed
- Velocity resets each frame (responsive controls)

---

### âœ… 3. Camera System
**File**: `lib/game/controllers/camera_controller.dart`

- **Smooth camera following** - Lerps to target position
- **Right-click drag rotation** - WoW-style camera control
- **Mouse scroll zoom** - 0.5x to 2.0x range
- **Configurable smoothness** - Adjustable follow speed
- **Mouse sensitivity** - Tunable rotation speed
- **Camera offset support** - For different view angles

**Camera Features:**
- Follows player automatically
- Smooth interpolation prevents jarring movement
- Mouse-based rotation (drag to look around)
- Zoom in/out with scroll wheel
- Ready for camera shake effects

---

### âœ… 4. Isometric Map
**File**: `lib/game/world/isometric_map.dart`

- **20x20 tile grid** - 400 tiles total
- **Diamond-shaped isometric tiles** - Classic isometric look
- **Checkerboard pattern** - Alternating colors for visibility
- **Grid-to-screen conversion** - Proper isometric math
- **Custom tile painter** - Flutter CustomPainter for rendering
- **Tile dimensions** - 64x32 pixels (width x height)

**Rendering System:**
- Each tile is a diamond shape
- Proper depth sorting (automatic with Flame)
- Grid coordinates map to screen space
- Ready for tile-based collision
- Easy to extend with different tile types

---

### âœ… 5. Game Integration
**File**: `lib/game/warchief_game.dart`

- **Complete keyboard handling** - All keys routed through InputManager
- **Mouse event handling** - Drag, scroll, hover all working
- **Camera follows player** - Smooth tracking
- **FPS counter** - Performance monitoring
- **Control hints overlay** - Instructions for players
- **Debug mode enabled** - Component boundaries visible

**Integration Points:**
- InputManager â†’ PlayerCharacter (movement)
- CameraController â†’ Camera (following)
- IsometricMap â†’ World (rendering)
- All systems update each frame
- Clean event delegation

## What Works Right Now

1. **Walk around** - Use WASD to move your character
2. **Turn around** - Press Q/E to rotate
3. **Jump** - Press Space (watch the scale animation!)
4. **Look around** - Right-click and drag to rotate camera
5. **Zoom** - Scroll to zoom in/out
6. **See FPS** - Performance counter in top-left
7. **Read controls** - Hints displayed on screen

## Known Limitations (By Design)

These are intentional for Phase 1:

1. **Simple graphics** - Blue circle for player (sprites in Phase 2)
2. **Basic tiles** - Solid color diamonds (textures in Phase 2)
3. **No UI elements** - Action bars, health bars coming in Phase 2
4. **No NPCs yet** - Phase 4 feature
5. **No combat** - Phase 3 feature
6. **No sound** - Phase 8 feature

4. **SVG/PNG Asset Loading** - Use flutter_svg
5. **Keybind Settings Screen** - Rebind keys via UI

Estimated: 1-2 weeks

## Conclusion

Phase 1 is **100% COMPLETE** with all goals achieved:

âœ… Flutter project with Flame engine
âœ… Isometric tile rendering
âœ… Player character with WASD movement
âœ… Camera controller with mouse
âœ… Input manager with keybinds

**The game is fully playable and ready for Phase 2!**
