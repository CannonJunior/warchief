### ✅ Completed - 2026-02-22

#### Channeled Ability Visual Effects
- ✅ **ChannelEffect enum**: Added `ChannelEffect` enum (none, lifeDrain, blizzard, earthquake, conduit) to `ability_types.dart`. Added `channelEffect` field to `AbilityData` with full serialization support (constructor, copyWith, toJson, fromJson, applyOverrides).
- ✅ **Channel effects overlay**: Created `channel_effects_overlay.dart` — Flutter overlay widget with `CustomPainter` for each effect type:
  - **Life Drain**: 5 purple vortex arcs spiraling from target to caster + bright center stream
  - **Blizzard**: 40 ice crystal diamonds falling from sky in AoE + ground ring
  - **Earthquake**: 35 earth particles erupting in parabolic arcs + ground ring
  - **Conduit**: 3 jagged lightning bolts from sky to target + impact glow + caster connection
- ✅ **Fixed channeled ability execution**: Blizzard, Earthquake, and Conduit now use `_startChanneledAbility` instead of instant execution. Added `channelAoeCenter` field to GameState for AoE positioning. Added dedicated `_executeConduit` function.
- ✅ **Wired overlay into game**: `ChannelEffectOverlay` added to `game3d_widget.dart` widget tree between damage indicators and stance effects.
- ✅ **Editor dropdown**: Added `channelEffect` dropdown to ability editor panel mechanics section, with full save/load/preview support. Users can select a channel effect when editing or creating channeled abilities.
- ✅ Build verified clean (`flutter build web`)

#### Fix Buff/Debuff Display on Target Frame and Active Character
- ✅ **Fixed `_minionIndex` always empty**: `rebuildMinionIndex()` was called during `spawnMinions()` before `refreshAliveMinions()` had populated the cache, building an empty index that was never rebuilt. Fixed by iterating `minions` directly (not the cached `aliveMinions`) and rebuilding each frame in `refreshAliveMinions()`.
- ✅ **Target frame now shows buffs/debuffs**: `currentTargetActiveEffects` getter works correctly now that `_minionIndex` is populated — debuffs on targeted minions/boss display in the `BuffDebuffIcons` widget to the right of the target frame.
- ✅ **Active character effects**: Added `activeCharacterActiveEffects` getter that returns effects for the currently controlled character (Warchief's `playerActiveEffects` or active ally/summon's `activeEffects`). Combat HUD player frame now uses this instead of `playerActiveEffects`.
- ✅ **Buffs and debuffs both display**: `BuffDebuffIcons` widget already renders two rows (buffs on top, debuffs below) — now visible on both the target frame and active character frame.
- ✅ Build verified clean (`flutter build web`)

#### Channeled Abilities, Heal Numbers, Combat Number Settings
- ✅ **Channeling state**: Added `isChanneling`, `channelProgress`, `channelDuration`, `channelingAbilityName`, `channelingSlotIndex` to GameState. `channelPercentage` returns 1.0→0.0 (drains). `cancelChannel()` resets state. Updated `isPerformingAction` to include channeling.
- ✅ **Channeling bar**: Extended `cast_bar.dart` to handle channeling (purple, 0xFF9B59B6). Progress drains from full to empty. Label shows "Channeling". Movement cancels channeling (input_system.dart).
- ✅ **Channeling system**: `updateChannelingState()` in ability_system ticks channel progress and applies periodic damage/heal ticks (1/sec via `_channelTickAccum`). Life Drain converted from projectile to channeled ability.
- ✅ **Green heal numbers**: Added `isHeal` flag to `DamageIndicator`. Heals display in green (0xFF44FF44) with `+` prefix. Added `_showHealIndicator()` helper. Heal indicators added to all 7 heal sites (basic heal, greater heal, lifesteal, generic heal, windshear ally heal, boss dark heal, channel tick heal).
- ✅ **Font size +10% / bolder**: Melee 30→33, ranged 33→36.3. FontWeight `bold`→`w900`.
- ✅ **Killing blow shadows**: Black shadow (blur 4, offset 1,1) + yellow shadow (0xFFFFDD00, blur 8, offset 0,0).
- ✅ **Combat Number settings**: Added `showDamageNumbers`, `showHealNumbers`, `showChannelBar` (bool), `damageNumberScale` (double) to `GameplaySettings` with SharedPreferences persistence.
- ✅ **Settings UI**: "Combat Numbers" section in General tab with toggles for damage/heal numbers and channel bar, plus a slider for number scale (50%–200%).
- ✅ **Settings wired to rendering**: Damage/heal indicators filtered by settings in `DamageIndicatorOverlay.build()`. Font size multiplied by `damageNumberScale`. Channel bar hidden when `showChannelBar` is false in `cast_bar.dart`.
- ✅ Build verified clean (`flutter build web`)

#### Summon Skeleton Mage + Skeleton Specialization
- ✅ **Summon Skeleton Mage ability**: New `summonSkeletonMage` ability in `NecromancerAbilities` (blue-tinted, 30s cooldown, 60s duration). Registered in `all` list, legacy access in `abilities_config.dart`, switch case + mana cost (60 blue) in `ability_system.dart`.
- ✅ **Skeleton Warrior (red melee)**: Red mana attunement via `temporaryAttunements`, 50 red mana pool, action bar pre-loaded with Sword, Heavy Strike, Whirlwind, Crushing Blow, Charge.
- ✅ **Skeleton Mage (blue caster)**: Blue mana attunement, 100 blue mana pool, 20 HP, 1.8 move speed, action bar pre-loaded with Fireball, Frost Bolt, Arcane Missile, Ice Shard, Frost Nova.
- ✅ **Doubled durations**: Both summon abilities and spawn methods use 60s (up from 30s).
- ✅ **Refactored spawn helpers**: Extracted `_summonSpawnPosition()` and `_setupSummonActionBar()` to share logic between both spawn methods.
- ✅ Build verified clean (`flutter build web`)

#### Summon Skeleton: Controllable Summoned Units
- ✅ **Ally model fields**: Added `isSummoned`, `summonDuration`, `summonDurationMax`, `name` fields to `Ally` class with constructor defaults.
- ✅ **GameState helpers**: Added `isActiveSummoned`, `activeActionBarSlots` getters, `tickSummonDurations(dt)` for auto-despawn, and `spawnSummonedSkeleton()` to create bone-colored cube ally with 30s lifespan.
- ✅ **Ability system**: Replaced `_executeSummonSkeleton` stub with real spawn call. Skeleton spawns 3 units in front of caster at terrain height.
- ✅ **Action bar delimitation**: Summoned units show only 5 action bar slots (Row 2 hidden). Player characters retain all 10 slots.
- ✅ **Abilities Codex lock**: Drag-to-action-bar disabled when controlling a summoned unit. Visual indicator "(Summoned unit — action bar locked)" shown in Codex header.
- ✅ **Duration ticking**: `tickSummonDurations(dt)` called each frame in game3d_widget update loop. Expired summons auto-despawn with console log. Control returns to Warchief if active summon expires.
- ✅ **Character switching**: Summoned units fully participate in `[`/`]` cycling alongside Warchief and permanent allies.
- ✅ Build verified clean (`flutter build web`)

#### Console.log Tab in Chat Panel
- ✅ **New Console tab**: Added 4th tab to the AI Chat panel (Spirit, Raid, Combat, **Console**) with green terminal theme and INFO/WARN/ERR level prefixes.
- ✅ **Console log model**: Created `console_log_entry.dart` with `ConsoleLogLevel` enum (info, warn, error) and `ConsoleLogEntry` class.
- ✅ **Console log tab widget**: Created `console_log_tab.dart` following `combat_log_tab.dart` pattern — green-themed, monospace, reverse-chronological, color-coded by level.
- ✅ **GameState integration**: Added `consoleLogMessages` list and `addConsoleLog()` helper with automatic trimming (>250 → keep 200).
- ✅ **Ability system logging**: All ability executions log to console. Blocked abilities log with reason (cooldown, casting, range, mana, attunement). 6 stub abilities (Summon Skeleton, Taunt, Fortify, Smoke Bomb, Sprint, Battle Shout) log as ERR with "STUB" label.
- ✅ **Mana failure logging**: All 4 mana colors log insufficient mana with current/required amounts.
- ✅ **Stance switch logging**: Logged to console on every stance change.
- ✅ **Target change logging**: Logged on setTarget() and clearTarget().
- ✅ Build verified clean (`flutter build web`)

### ✅ Completed - 2026-02-21

#### Project Documentation Overhaul
- ✅ **Rewrote root CLAUDE.md**: Removed stale Mojo/Python/RAG references. Now accurately describes the Flutter/Dart game project with mandatory doc-reading instructions.
- ✅ **Rewrote warchief_game/CLAUDE.md**: Added complete file map with line counts, subsystem doc references (read-before-explore table), oversized file split roadmap, architecture patterns, game loop description, and key dependency list.
- ✅ **Archived 12 stale docs**: Moved completed/historical documentation to `warchief_game/docs/archive/` (PHASE1_COMPLETE.md, TERRAIN_FIXES_COMPLETE.md, TERRAIN_RESEARCH.md, PERFORMANCE_FIXES_COMPLETED.md, PERFORMANCE_MITIGATION_PLAN.md, ROLLBACK_PLAN.md, GAME_BEHAVIOR_CHECKLIST.md, GOALS_SYSTEM_DESIGN.md, AI_INTEGRATION.md, CLAUDE_TASK_TEMPLATE.md, ABILITY_TEST_EVALUATION.md, WARCHIEF-CONTEXT-ENGINEERING-PROMPT.md).
- ✅ **Audited all 218 source files**: Identified 14 files exceeding the 500-line limit with specific split strategies for each.
- ✅ **Minimap position fix**: Fixed InterfaceConfig default position for minimap from Offset(0,0) to Offset(1410,8) — was rendering hidden behind the instructions overlay.

#### Optimization & Tech Debt Fixes
- ✅ **dart:math delegation**: Replaced 32 lines of custom Taylor/Newton math approximations in game_state.dart with 4 one-liner delegates to `dart:math` (hardware-accelerated, more accurate).
- ✅ **Controller memory leak fix**: stance_editor_panel.dart now reuses TextEditingControllers on stance switch instead of recreating 26 controllers per switch.
- ✅ **Combat log trim standardization**: All 10 trim sites across 3 files now consistently use `> 250 → removeRange(0, len - 200)` instead of mixed `> 200 → removeAt(0)` patterns.
- ✅ **Resize handle deduplication**: Replaced 170 lines of 8 near-identical resize handles in abilities_modal.dart with a 110-line `_buildResizeHandles()` helper.
- ✅ **ActiveStance getter caching**: combat_system.dart now caches `gameState.activeStance` once before the dodge check instead of calling the getter 3 times (each call does registry lookup + override merge + copyWith).

#### Tab Targeting Improvements (WoW-inspired)
- ✅ **Melee range priority tier**: Three-tier sorting — enemies within melee range (≤5 units) are always first, sorted by distance. Then front-cone (≤60°) sorted by angle. Then everything else by distance. Melee characters always tab to the closest hittable enemy.
- ✅ **Max range filter**: Enemies beyond 50 units are excluded from tab targeting entirely. Prevents tab-targeting distant enemies you can't reach.
- ✅ **First-tab selects best target**: First tab press with no target selects index 0 (nearest/best priority) instead of skipping to index 1. Subsequent presses cycle through the sorted list.
- ✅ **Fresh sort on each keypress**: Cache is invalidated on each tab press so the sort reflects current positions and facing direction, not a 0.2s-stale snapshot.
- ✅ **Active character targeting**: Input handler now uses `activeTransform`/`activeRotation` instead of `playerTransform` — fixes tab targeting when controlling allies.
- ✅ **Auto-target on hit**: When the player takes damage with no current target, automatically acquires the nearest enemy (WoW behavior).
- ✅ **Auto-target on kill**: When current target dies, automatically picks the next nearest enemy so melee players keep swinging without manual re-targeting.
- ✅ **Fixed sort comparator**: Replaced lossy `.toInt()` and `.sign.toInt()` comparisons with proper `.compareTo()` for correct double ordering.
- ✅ Build verified clean (`flutter build web`)

#### Abilities Codex Resizable Panel
- ✅ **Resizable borders**: All 4 edges and 4 corners of the Abilities Codex panel are draggable to resize. Right/bottom expand, left/top expand while shifting position to keep the opposite edge anchored.
- ✅ **Size constraints**: Min 500x400, max 1200x900 to prevent over/under-sizing.
- ✅ **Cursor feedback**: MouseRegion wrappers show appropriate resize cursors (resizeColumn, resizeRow, resizeDownRight, resizeUpLeft, etc.) on hover.
- ✅ **Header drag-to-move**: Panel repositioning now only triggers from the header bar (not the entire panel surface), so resize handles don't conflict with dragging.
- ✅ **Dynamic layout**: Panel width/height stored as state variables (`_panelWidth`, `_panelHeight`), replacing hardcoded 750x600. Editor panel total width calculation uses dynamic width.
- ✅ Build verified clean (`flutter build web`)

#### Combat Stance Revamp: 5-Way Rock-Paper-Scissors Metagame
- ✅ **7 new StanceData fields**: Added `spellPushbackInflicted`, `spellPushbackResistance`, `ccDurationInflicted`, `ccDurationReceived`, `lifestealRatio`, `dodgeChance`, `manaCostDisruption` to `stance_types.dart` with constructor defaults, `copyWith`, `applyOverrides`, and `modifierSummary`.
- ✅ **Parsing**: Added 7 new fields to `_parseStance()` in `stance_definitions.dart` with safe `?.toDouble() ?? default` pattern.
- ✅ **Revised stance values**: Updated `stance_config.json` with rebalanced multipliers for all 5 stances creating a pentagonal RPS graph (Fury>BW/Drunken, Tide>Fury/Phantom, Phantom>Fury/Drunken, Drunken>Tide/BW, BW>Phantom/Tide).
- ✅ **Dodge mechanic**: In `combat_system.dart`, player dodge check before damage application. Uses static `math.Random` instance. Shows "DODGED" in combat log. Skipped for target dummy.
- ✅ **Spell pushback**: In `combat_system.dart`, after player takes damage while casting, pushes back `castProgress` by `castTime * 0.25 * (1 - resistance)`. Capped at 3 pushbacks per cast via `castPushbackCount` on GameState. Tide immune (1.0 resistance).
- ✅ **Lifesteal**: `_applyLifesteal()` helper in `ability_system.dart`. Heals by `damage * lifestealRatio` (NOT modified by healingMultiplier). Called at all hit points: `_autoHitCurrentTarget`, `_damageTargetWithProjectile`, non-homing projectile hits, AoE hits (Whirlwind, Frost Nova, generic AoE).
- ✅ **CC duration modifiers**: `_applyMeleeStatusEffect()`, `_applyDoTFromProjectile()`, and Fear effect multiply status duration by `activeStance.ccDurationInflicted`.
- ✅ **Stance editor**: Added COMBAT INTERACTIONS section with 7 new fields, controllers, populate, dispose, override map, and tooltips in `stance_editor_panel.dart`.
- ✅ Build verified clean (`flutter build web`)

#### Ability Category Reordering in Codex
- ✅ **AbilityOrderManager**: Created `lib/game3d/state/ability_order_manager.dart` — per-category ability ordering persisted via SharedPreferences. Stores `Map<String, List<String>>` keyed by category name. Reconciles with registry on access (new abilities appended, removed abilities pruned). Global `globalAbilityOrderManager` instance.
- ✅ **Reorderable ability lists**: Each category in the "Potential Future Abilities" section uses `ReorderableListView.builder` for drag-to-reorder. Drag handle icons on the left of each card. `onReorder` callback saves order via manager.
- ✅ **Slot number badges**: First 10 abilities in each category show numbered badges (1–9, 0) matching action bar hotkey slots, so the user knows which abilities will load.
- ✅ **Load to Action Bar uses order**: `_loadClassToActionBar` now loads abilities in user-defined order via `globalAbilityOrderManager.getOrderedAbilities()`.
- ✅ **Reset custom order**: Categories with custom order show a reset icon to revert to default registry order.
- ✅ **Initialization**: `globalAbilityOrderManager` initialized in `game3d_widget.dart` alongside other managers.
- ✅ Build verified clean (`flutter build web`)

### ✅ Completed - 2026-02-20

#### Auto-Hit for Melee and Ranged Abilities
- ✅ **Auto-hit intended target**: Melee and ranged abilities that can be successfully cast now automatically hit the intended target — no collision check needed. Uses `_autoHitCurrentTarget()` helper that routes damage to the specific target type (boss, minion, dummy) by ID.
- ✅ **Face target on strike**: All melee abilities (`updateAbility1`, `_executeHeavyStrikeEffect`, `_executeCrushingBlowEffect`, `_executeGenericWindupMelee`) call `_faceCurrentTarget()` to rotate the character toward the target before dealing damage.
- ✅ **Homing projectile auto-hit**: Homing ranged projectiles (ability 2) auto-hit at 2.5-unit threshold and skip general collision checks, preventing interception by non-targeted enemies.
- ✅ **Collision fallback**: When no target is selected, all abilities fall back to collision-based detection in the forward direction (legacy behavior preserved).
- ✅ **Piercing unaffected**: AOE abilities (Whirlwind) and non-homing projectiles retain collision-based detection for hitting non-targeted units.
- ✅ **Side effects preserved**: `_autoHitCurrentTarget()` handles red mana generation, melee streak tracking, kill goal events, and alive minion refresh — matching the side effects of the collision-based path.
- ✅ Build verified clean (`flutter build web`)

#### Blue Ley Line Overlay Enhancement
- ✅ **Thicker ley lines**: Line width multiplied by 2.5x with a soft glow layer underneath (3x width, pulsing opacity). Lines use rounded caps for cleaner visuals.
- ✅ **Prominent power nodes**: Nodes now render with four layers — outer pulsing glow ring, pulsing stroke ring border, solid core circle (1.2x radius), and bright center highlight. All pulse with elapsed time.
- ✅ **Blue mana attunement gate**: Ley lines and power nodes only render when `activeManaAttunements.contains(ManaColor.blue)` AND toggle is enabled. Replaces old `hideLeyLinesByAttunement` logic (which was gated behind `manaSourceVisibilityGated` setting).
- ✅ **Toggle icon**: Hub/network icon (Icons.hub) on minimap border at top-right (below green toggle when both attuned). Click toggles `minimapState.showBlueOverlay` on/off. Blue when active, dim when inactive. Tooltip shows "Show/Hide ley lines".
- ✅ **Entity painter gated**: Ley power node diamonds in `MinimapEntityPainter` also gated behind the same blue attunement + toggle check.
- ✅ **State**: Added `showBlueOverlay` boolean to `MinimapState` (defaults to true).
- ✅ Build verified clean (`flutter build web`)

#### Minimap Green Mana Source Overlay
- ✅ **Green mana overlay painter**: Created `minimap_green_painter.dart` — CustomPainter drawing three layers of green mana source information:
  - **Grass zones**: Coarse grid (4px step) sampling terrain height, tinting areas with grass weight in translucent green. Uses the same normalized height formula (0.15-0.65 range, peak at 0.4) as the actual green mana regen calculation.
  - **Spirit being auras**: Pulsing green rings around allies in spirit form, showing the `spiritBeingRadius` (6.0 units default) within which they broadcast 3.0/sec green mana regen. Leaf icon at center.
  - **Nature creatures**: Prominent pulsing glow rings + leaf icon around elemental and beast faction minions (e.g. Dryad Lifebinder). These are the "natural creatures that replenish high amounts of green mana."
  - Also shows proximity radius rings around green-attuned allies (green mana proximity regen sources).
- ✅ **Green mana attunement gate**: Overlay only renders when `activeManaAttunements.contains(ManaColor.green)`. Toggle icon also only appears when green-attuned.
- ✅ **Toggle icon**: Eco leaf icon (Icons.eco) on minimap border at top-right corner. Click toggles `minimapState.showGreenOverlay` on/off. Green when active, dim when inactive. Tooltip shows "Show/Hide green mana sources".
- ✅ **Layer ordering**: Green overlay placed between terrain and entity layers so grass zones appear beneath entity blips.
- ✅ **State**: Added `showGreenOverlay` boolean to `MinimapState` (defaults to true).
- ✅ Build verified clean (`flutter build web`)

#### Minimap Wind Overlay
- ✅ **Wind overlay painter**: Created `minimap_wind_painter.dart` — CustomPainter drawing animated dashed flow lines across the minimap in the wind direction. Line opacity/count scales with wind strength. Lines scroll along the wind direction for animated flow effect. Handles both rotating and fixed-north minimap modes.
- ✅ **Derecho prominence**: During derecho storms, overlay intensifies with orange pulsing radial glow, thicker/brighter flow lines that lerp from blue-white to orange with intensity, and a "DERECHO" label at top of minimap that fades in above 30% intensity.
- ✅ **White mana attunement gate**: Overlay only renders when the active character's `activeManaAttunements` contains `ManaColor.white`. Toggle icon also only appears when white-attuned.
- ✅ **Toggle icon**: Wind icon (Icons.air) added to minimap border at top-left corner. Click toggles `minimapState.showWindOverlay` on/off. Icon is blue-silver when active, dim when inactive, pulses orange during derecho. Tooltip shows "Show/Hide wind overlay".
- ✅ **State**: Added `showWindOverlay` boolean to `MinimapState` (defaults to true).
- ✅ Build verified clean (`flutter build web`)

#### Simplify Movement+Damage Abilities
- ✅ **Target-seeking dashes**: Non-AOE abilities with movement+damage now move the character toward the targeted enemy instead of dashing straight forward. Dash snaps player rotation to face target during travel.
- ✅ **Guaranteed hits**: Targeted dashes always deal damage on arrival — no collision check needed (uses `collisionThreshold: 999.0`). Damage applies when player arrives within 1.5 units or at 90% of dash duration, whichever comes first.
- ✅ **Unified `_startDash()` helper**: All dash-type abilities now go through a single `_startDash()` method that stores the ability data, duration, and snapshot of target position. Replaces 6 separate manual ability4 setups.
- ✅ **Auto-routing for generic melee gap-closers**: `_executeGenericMelee()` detects abilities with range >= 4.0 (non-AOE) and routes them through the dash system automatically. Covers Umbral Lunge, Storm Surge, Shoulder Charge, and any future gap-closers.
- ✅ **`getCurrentTargetPosition()`**: New GameState method returning the world position of the current target (boss, minion, dummy, or ally), used by dash targeting.
- ✅ **Abilities converted**: Dash Attack, Charge, Gale Step, Flying Serpent Strike, Wind Warp (ground), plus all data-driven melee gap-closers via the generic routing.
- ✅ **No-target fallback**: If no target is selected, dashes move straight forward with original collision detection (legacy behavior preserved).
- ✅ Build verified clean (`flutter build web`)

#### Flight Mechanics Enhancements
- ✅ **Groundspeed HUD**: Added `flightGroundSpeed` field to `GameState`, displayed in `FlightBuffIcon` alongside altitude (`Alt: X.X  Spd: X.X`)
- ✅ **Double-tap hard banking**: Q/E double-tap within configurable window (0.3s default) activates 50% faster bank rate and 90-degree max bank angle. Static timing fields in `InputSystem` with edge-detection on key release/press
- ✅ **Spacebar speed boost**: Spacebar now boosts flight speed (1.8x default) at cost of white mana (8.0/s default), replacing the old air brake + upward bump behavior
- ✅ **Turn speed reduction**: Yaw rate tracked per frame; groundspeed reduced proportionally to turn rate (up to 30% at max turn). Simulates aerodynamic drag
- ✅ **Config values**: Added 6 new flight config entries to `wind_config.json` and `WindConfig` getters: `doubleTapWindow`, `hardBankRateMultiplier`, `hardBankMaxAngle`, `spaceBoostMultiplier`, `spaceBoostManaCostPerSecond`, `turnSpeedReductionFactor`
- ✅ **Tuning tab**: All new config fields added to Wind > FLIGHT section in Tuning tab with tooltips
- ✅ Build verified clean (`flutter build web`)

#### Runtime Config Editing (Tuning Tab)
- ✅ **Override persistence for 5 config classes**: Added `_overrides` map, `_loadOverrides()`, `_saveOverrides()`, `setOverride()`, `clearOverride()`, `clearAllOverrides()`, `hasOverride()`, `overrides` getter, `getDefault()` to WindConfig, BuildingConfig, MinimapConfig, MacroConfig, GoalsConfig — all using SharedPreferences with unique storage keys
- ✅ **GameConfig conversion**: Converted from static `const`/`final` class to JSON-loaded instance class following ManaConfig pattern. Static getters delegate to global instance for zero call-site changes. Created `assets/data/game_config.json` with all values including Vector3 color components. Auto-creates instance in `_i` getter for safe field-initializer access. Added override persistence (SharedPreferences key `game_config_overrides`)
- ✅ **Generic ConfigEditorPanel**: Created `lib/game3d/ui/settings/config_editor_panel.dart` — reusable config editor widget taking `ConfigSectionDef` and `ConfigCallbacks`. Supports double, int, bool, and string field types. Save persists only changed fields as overrides, Restore Defaults clears all overrides. Same visual style as AbilityEditorPanel (dark theme, cyan accents, section grouping)
- ✅ **Tuning tab in Settings**: Created `lib/game3d/ui/settings/tuning_tab.dart` — new "Tuning" tab in Settings panel with sub-navigation for 7 config systems: Game (9 sections), Mana (3 sections), Wind (8 sections), Buildings (1 section), Minimap (8 sections), Macros (3 sections), Goals (1 section). Each renders a ConfigEditorPanel with complete field definitions and tooltips
- ✅ **Settings panel integration**: Added Tuning tab to `settings_panel.dart` tab list between General and Interfaces
- ✅ Build verified clean (`flutter build web`)

#### Editable Stance System
- ✅ **StanceData.copyWith() + applyOverrides()**: Added `copyWith()` with all 22 stance fields and `applyOverrides(Map<String, dynamic>)` with sparse override merging, Vector3 color [r,g,b] list handling, and bool support
- ✅ **StanceOverrideManager**: Created `lib/game3d/state/stance_override_manager.dart` — sparse override persistence (SharedPreferences key `stance_overrides`), `getEffectiveStance()`, `setOverrides()`, `clearOverrides()`, `hasOverrides()`, `loadOverrides()`, global `globalStanceOverrideManager`
- ✅ **Barrel Export**: Updated `lib/game3d/data/stances/stances.dart` to re-export `stance_override_manager.dart`
- ✅ **Initialization**: Wired `_initializeStanceOverrides()` in `game3d_widget.dart` alongside other config singletons
- ✅ **activeStance Getter**: Modified `game_state.dart` to apply user overrides via `globalStanceOverrideManager.getEffectiveStance()` between base registry lookup and Drunken Master random roll; simplified Drunken Master branch to use `copyWith()` instead of full constructor
- ✅ **StanceEditorPanel**: Created `lib/game3d/ui/stance_editor_panel.dart` (~400 lines) — side-panel editor with sections: IDENTITY (name read-only, description editable), MULTIPLIERS (9 double fields), PASSIVES (8 doubles + 3 bool toggles), SWITCHING (switchCooldown), VISUAL (color RGB); Save builds sparse override map, Restore Defaults clears overrides; tooltips on all fields
- ✅ **StanceCardsSection Double-Tap**: Added `onDoubleTap` callback prop to `StanceCardsSection` in `stance_selector.dart`, wired to open `StanceEditorPanel` in abilities modal
- ✅ **Override Indicator**: Yellow edit icon shown on stance cards with active overrides; modifier summary displays effective (overridden) values
- ✅ **Abilities Modal Integration**: Added `_editingStance` state to `abilities_modal.dart`, mutually exclusive with ability editor (opening one closes the other), total width accounts for either editor panel
- ✅ Build verified clean (`flutter build web`)

### ✅ Completed - 2026-02-19

#### Exotic Stance System
- ✅ **Data Layer**: Created `assets/data/stance_config.json` with 5 exotic stances (Drunken Master, Blood Weave, Tide, Phantom Dance, Fury of the Ancestors) — all values config-driven, not hardcoded
- ✅ **Stance Types**: Created `lib/game3d/data/stances/stance_types.dart` — `StanceId` enum, `StanceData` class with all modifiers, passive mechanics, modifier summary builder
- ✅ **Stance Registry**: Created `lib/game3d/data/stances/stance_definitions.dart` — `StanceRegistry` singleton loading from JSON config, icon/color parsing, global accessor
- ✅ **Barrel Export**: Created `lib/game3d/data/stances/stances.dart`
- ✅ **GameState Integration**: Added stance fields (`playerStance`, `stanceSwitchCooldown`, `stanceActiveTime`, Drunken re-roll fields), `activeStance` getter (with Drunken random modifier substitution), `switchStance()` (with HP proportion scaling), `cycleStance()`, `updateStanceTimers()` (Fury drain, Drunken re-rolls, cooldown ticking), `generateManaFromDamageTaken()` (Tide passive)
- ✅ **Ally Model**: Added `currentStance` field to `Ally`
- ✅ **Movement Speed**: Applied `movementSpeedMultiplier` in `effectivePlayerSpeed` getter
- ✅ **Max Health**: Applied `maxHealthMultiplier` in `playerMaxHealth` getter
- ✅ **Damage Output**: Applied `damageMultiplier` in melee hits (`updateAbility1`), projectile impacts (`_damageTargetWithProjectile`, `updateAbility2` collision), AoE (`_executeGenericAoE`)
- ✅ **Damage Taken**: Applied `damageTakenMultiplier` in `combat_system.dart` for `DamageTarget.player`
- ✅ **Tide Passive**: Damage-to-mana conversion in combat_system after player damage

- ✅ **Cast/Windup Time**: Applied `castTimeMultiplier` in `_startCastTimeAbility()` and `_startWindupAbility()`
- ✅ **Healing**: Applied `healingMultiplier` in `_executeHeal()` and `_executeGenericHeal()`
- ✅ **Mana Costs**: Applied `manaCostMultiplier` in `_executeAbilityByName()`, Blood Weave HP-for-mana substitution for instant and deferred (cast/windup) abilities
- ✅ **Mana Regen**: Applied `manaRegenMultiplier` in `updateManaRegen()`, `updateWindAndWhiteMana()`, `updateGreenManaRegen()`; Blood Weave `convertsManaRegenToHeal` converts all mana regen to HP healing
- ✅ **Fury Health Drain**: 2% max HP/second in `updateStanceTimers()`, clamped to 1 HP, combat log on critical threshold
- ✅ **Drunken Re-rolls**: Independent damage/damageTaken re-rolls every 3s in `updateStanceTimers()`, combat log on re-roll
- ✅ **Stance Selector UI**: Created `lib/game3d/ui/stance_selector.dart` — compact icon (always visible) + expandable vertical list (X key), click to select, cooldown overlay, tooltips with modifier summary

- ✅ **Combat Log**: Stance switch logging, Drunken re-roll logging, Fury critical HP logging
- ✅ **Game Loop**: `updateStanceTimers(dt)` wired into `_update()`, stance registry initialized in `initState()`
- ✅ **Persistence**: Stance selections saved/loaded via SharedPreferences (`stance_player`, `stance_ally_N` keys), auto-saves on switch, loads after stance registry initialization
- ✅ **Visual Effects**: Created `lib/game3d/ui/stance_effects_overlay.dart` — Drunken Master purple tint pulse on re-roll (0.4s fade), Fury of the Ancestors red vignette intensifying as HP drops (visible below 80% HP)
- ✅ **Clickable Stance Icon Bar**: Created `lib/game3d/ui/unit_frames/stance_icon_bar.dart` — row of 6 clickable stance icons (None + 5 exotic) displayed above the player health bar in CombatHUD. Active stance is prominently highlighted with glowing colored border, larger size (30px vs 24px), and colored background. Tooltips show stance name, description, and modifier summary. Respects switch cooldown.
- ✅ **Default Stance**: Added `defaultStance` field to `StanceRegistry` loaded from config JSON (set to Tide). All characters initialize with the default stance when no saved preference exists.
- ✅ **Damage Modifier Audit**: Fixed missing `damageMultiplier` on 7 named ability damage paths — Frost Nova, Heavy Strike, Whirlwind, Crushing Blow, windup melee completion, Cyclone Dive, Dash Attack. Fixed missing `healingMultiplier` on Greater Heal (hardcoded 50.0).
- ✅ **Movement Speed Audit**: Fixed missing stance `movementSpeedMultiplier` on flight speed (input_system.dart), ally `activeEffectiveSpeed` (game_state.dart), and dash attack speed (ability_system.dart). Ground WASD/QE movement already had it via `effectivePlayerSpeed`.
- ✅ Build verified clean (`flutter build web`)

#### Fighting Game Melee Abilities + Generic Melee Damage Fix
- ✅ **Part A: Fixed generic melee damage system** — `_executeGenericMelee()` now stores active ability on `gameState.activeGenericMeleeAbility` so `updateAbility1()` reads damage/range/impactColor from AbilityData instead of hardcoded `playerSword` values; `_executeGenericWindupMelee()` now reads damage/range/impact from AbilityData instead of hardcoded 40.0/2.5/3.5; added `activeGenericMeleeAbility` nullable field to `GameState`

  - Utility (2): Quick Slash, Shoulder Charge
  - Greenseer (2): Lifebloom Touch, Thornguard Strike
- ✅ **Part C: Added case labels in ability_system.dart** — all 35 new abilities routed through `_executeGenericAbility()` via data-driven dispatch
- ✅ Build verified clean (`flutter build web`)
- ✅ All category files remain under 500 lines

#### Abilities Codex: Mana Cost Display + Balance Rating System
- ✅ Created `ability_balance.dart` — `ManaColorDisplay` extension (display colors matching mana bar midpoints), `computeBalanceScore()` pure function (power vs cost, clamped -1..1), `_statusEffectValue()` helper, `balanceScoreColor()` (red→yellow→green), `balanceScoreLabel()` (WEAK/BELOW AVG/BALANCED/ABOVE AVG/STRONG/OP)
- ✅ Added `export 'ability_balance.dart'` to `abilities.dart` barrel file
- ✅ Updated `abilities_modal.dart` — added mana color dots + cost to both `_buildAbilityCard` and `_buildCustomAbilityCard` stats rows, added balance indicator row below stats, added `_buildManaStat()` and `_buildBalanceIndicator()` helper widgets
- ✅ Updated `ability_editor_panel.dart` — added `_buildPreviewAbility()` (constructs AbilityData from current editor fields), `_buildEditorBalancePreview()` colored badge in header, live-update listeners on all balance-relevant text controllers
- ✅ Build verified clean (`flutter build web`)

### ✅ Completed - 2026-02-16

#### Green Mana System + Dual-Mana Abilities + 3 New Character Classes

- ✅ Implemented `updateGreenManaRegen(dt)` — grass-based regen, proximity regen from green-attuned allies, spirit being regen bonus, decay logic
- ✅ Updated `ability_system.dart` — added `green` to `_ManaType`, dual-mana check/spend logic, 30 new ability handlers (spiritkin/stormheart/greenseer)
- ✅ Created `spiritkin_abilities.dart` (10 abilities: green+red primal nature warriors)
- ✅ Created `stormheart_abilities.dart` (10 abilities: white+red lightning warriors)

- ✅ Added `manaAttunement` field (`List<ManaColor>`) to `Item` model — fromJson parses string array, toJson serializes, copyWithStackSize passes through
- ✅ Added `manaAttunements` getter to `Inventory` — scans equipped items and collects all mana colors
- ✅ Added `temporaryAttunements` field (`Set<ManaColor>`) to `Ally` model — for future buff/aura attunements
- ✅ Added `temporaryAttunements`, `playerManaAttunements`, `activeManaAttunements` to `GameState` — unified attunement getters for Warchief and active ally
- ✅ Added 4 talisman items to `items.json`: All-Source Talisman (legendary, all 3 colors), Talisman of the Ley (rare, blue), Talisman of Blood (rare, red), Talisman of the Wind (rare, white)
- ✅ Equipped All-Source Talisman on Warchief starting equipment, placed 3 single-color talismans in bag

- ✅ Gated ally blue/red/white mana regen behind per-ally attunement checks
- ✅ Added attunement gate in `ability_system.dart` `_executeAbilityByName()` — blocks mana abilities when not attuned to required color
- ✅ Updated `ManaBar` widget — only shows mana bars for attuned colors, gates info widgets (wind/ley line/power node) behind attunement, shows "No Mana Attunement" when empty
- ✅ Existing `amulet_of_fortitude` unchanged (defensive-only talisman, no attunement)
- ✅ Physical abilities (ManaColor.none, manaCost 0) work without any talisman
- ✅ Build verified clean (`flutter build web`)

#### Performance Optimizations
- ✅ Cached `AbilityRegistry.findByName` — results stored in `Map<String, AbilityData?>` so repeated lookups (every frame in buff/debuff icons) are O(1) instead of linear scans
- ✅ Fixed ley line mesh cache hash — now hashes segment endpoint coordinates instead of just count, preventing stale mesh when segments shift but count stays the same
- ⬜ Cooldown list refactor — replace 10 individual `abilityNCooldown` fields with a `List<double>` (147 references across 7 files, deferred to next session)
- ✅ Added `_minionIndex` map to `GameState` for O(1) minion lookup by `instanceId` — used by `currentTargetActiveEffects` instead of linear scan
- ✅ Added terrain color cache to `MinimapTerrainPainter` — static `List<Color>` grid only recomputed when player position/rotation/zoom changes, eliminating redundant height sampling and color interpolation on unchanged frames
- ✅ Build verified clean (`flutter build web`)

#### Buff/Debuff Icon Fixes & Ability Icon System
- ✅ Fixed CombatHUD target debuff icons — now shows effects for the actual current target (boss, minion, ally) instead of always showing boss effects via new `currentTargetActiveEffects` getter on `GameState`
- ✅ Created ability icon system — added `AbilityTypeIcon` extension on `AbilityType` in `ability_types.dart` with `.icon` getter, plus `typeIcon` and `flutterColor` getters on `AbilityData`
- ✅ Updated `BuffDebuffIcons` to look up source ability via `AbilityRegistry.findByName(effect.sourceName)` and use the ability's type icon and color instead of the `StatusEffect` mapping
- ✅ Updated `MinionFrames._buildBuffIndicators` to use the same ability icon lookup for active effects
- ✅ Consolidated Codex: replaced private `_getAbilityTypeIcon` in `abilities_modal.dart` with shared `ability.type.icon` extension
- ✅ Added mouse-over tooltips showing ability name to icons in both `BuffDebuffIcons` and `MinionFrames`
- ✅ Build verified clean (`flutter build web`)

#### Cast Time Fix, Haste & Melt Attributes
- ✅ Fixed cast/windup time accuracy — clamped `castProgress` to `currentCastTime` on completion so logged duration matches configured time exactly (previously overshot by up to one frame ~16ms)
- ✅ Added combat log entries for cast and windup completions — logged as `CombatLogType.ability` with source `'Player'` and duration in action text
- ✅ Added `haste` and `melt` integer fields to `ItemStats` — fromJson, toJson, nonZeroStats, totalEquippedStats all updated
- ✅ Added `activeHaste` and `activeMelt` getters to `GameState` — reads from active character's equipped item stats
- ✅ Applied Haste to `_startCastTimeAbility` and `_startWindupAbility` — formula: `baseTime / (1 + haste/100)` (100% Haste halves a 2s cast to 1s)
- ✅ Applied Melt to `_setCooldownForSlot` — formula: `baseCooldown / (1 + melt/100)` (same scaling as Haste)
- ✅ Build verified clean (`flutter build web`)

#### Attunement Settings Toggles
- ✅ Created `lib/game3d/state/gameplay_settings.dart` — `GameplaySettings` class with `attunementRequired` and `manaSourceVisibilityGated` booleans, SharedPreferences persistence via `load()`/`save()`
- ✅ Added `globalGameplaySettings` singleton initialized in `game3d_widget.dart` alongside other config singletons
- ✅ Added "Mana Attunement" section to Settings > General tab with two toggles:
  - **Require Mana Attunement** (default ON) — when off, all characters have full access to all mana pools unconditionally (pre-talisman behavior)
  - **Gate Mana Source Visibility** (default OFF) — when on, hides Ley Lines (blue) and wind particles (white) if the active character lacks the corresponding attunement
- ✅ All attunement getters (`playerManaAttunements`, `activeManaAttunements`, ally attunements) return all three colors when `attunementRequired` is disabled
- ✅ Gated 3D Ley Line rendering in `render_system.dart` — hidden when active character is not blue-attuned and visibility toggle is on
- ✅ Gated wind particle rendering in `render_system.dart` — hidden when active character is not white-attuned and visibility toggle is on
- ✅ Gated minimap Ley Line/power node drawing in `minimap_terrain_painter.dart` — hidden by same blue attunement check
- ✅ Added `_buildSectionHeader()` helper to `settings_panel.dart` for styled category headers
- ✅ Settings persist across sessions via SharedPreferences
- ✅ Build verified clean (`flutter build web`)

### ✅ Completed - 2026-02-15

- ✅ Passed `sourceName` (from `projectile.abilityName`) when creating DoT effects in `_applyDoTFromProjectile()`
- ✅ Added `_logDoTTick()` helper to `GameState` — spawns a floating `DamageIndicator` at the target's world position and adds a `CombatLogEntry` (with ability name and status effect type) for every DoT tick
- ✅ Wired `_logDoTTick()` into all four entity loops in `updateActiveEffects()`: player, boss monster, allies, and minions
- ✅ Build verified clean (`flutter build web`)

#### Fix Custom Ability Colors, Load-to-Action-Bar, Add Type Filter, Fix DoT Ticking
- ✅ Fixed `_buildCustomAbilityCard()` in `abilities_modal.dart` — replaced hardcoded `Colors.green` background/border/star with `_getCategoryColor(ability.category)` so custom abilities in built-in categories show the correct color
- ✅ Fixed `_loadClassToActionBar()` — now combines `AbilityRegistry.getByCategory()` + `globalCustomAbilityManager.getByCategory()` so custom abilities load to action bar alongside built-in ones
- ✅ Fixed `_buildLoadClassRow()` dropdown — count includes custom abilities; custom-only categories appear in dropdown
- ✅ Added `_enabledTypes` set and `_typeFilterExpanded` toggle state to `_AbilitiesModalState`
- ✅ Built `_buildTypeFilter()` — non-scrolling type filter bar below category filter with: type count indicator, All/None quick-toggle, expand/collapse, colored chips per `AbilityType`
- ✅ Built `_buildTypeFilterChip()` — tappable checkbox chips colored by `_getTypeColor()`, toggling type in `_enabledTypes`

- ✅ Added `_applyDoTFromProjectile()` — creates `ActiveEffect` with DoT data on target (boss or minion) when projectile hits
- ✅ Wired DoT application in both homing (`_damageTargetWithProjectile`) and non-homing (`checkAndDamageEnemies`) hit paths
- ✅ Updated `updateActiveEffects(dt)` in `game_state.dart` — accumulates tick time per effect; applies `damagePerTick` damage when accumulator reaches `tickInterval` for player, boss, allies, and minions
- ✅ Added `Soul Rot` necromancer DoT ability — `AbilityType.dot`, 60 damage over 5 ticks across 10s, `StatusEffect.poison`, fires projectile that applies DoT `ActiveEffect` on hit
- ✅ Wired `Soul Rot` in `ability_system.dart` — named handler `_executeSoulRot()`, mana cost entry (30 blue), switch case dispatch
- ✅ Fixed ability overrides not persisting to game execution — added `_effective()` helper to `AbilitySystem` that applies `AbilityOverrideManager` overrides; wrapped all ~45 raw ability references (`XxxAbilities.yyy`) with `_effective()`; also applied overrides in generic execution methods (`_executeGenericProjectile`, `_executeGenericMelee`, `_executeGenericAoE`, `_executeGenericHeal`)
- ✅ Build verified clean (`flutter build web`)

#### Buff/Debuff Icons in CombatHUD + Fix Fear Ability
- ✅ Added `StatusEffect.fear` to enum in `ability_types.dart` — causes uncontrolled fleeing
- ✅ Changed Fear ability in `necromancer_abilities.dart` to use `StatusEffect.fear` (was `StatusEffect.stun`)
- ✅ Created `lib/models/active_effect.dart` — `ActiveEffect` class with type, remainingDuration, totalDuration, strength, isBuff/isDebuff, tick(), progress, iconFor(), colorFor()

- ✅ Wired `updateActiveEffects(dt)` in `game3d_widget.dart` game loop after mana updates
- ✅ Fixed `_executeFear()` in `ability_system.dart` — applies fear ActiveEffect to boss, generates flee BezierPath away from player, logs to combat log
- ✅ Added fear/stun checks in `ai_system.dart` `updateMonsterAI()` — feared monster regenerates flee paths, stunned monster stops movement, both skip normal AI
- ✅ Created `lib/game3d/ui/unit_frames/buff_debuff_icons.dart` — reusable widget showing buff row (top) and debuff row (bottom) with color-coded icons and progress ring overlay
- ✅ Added BuffDebuffIcons to `combat_hud.dart` — LEFT of player frame, RIGHT of target frame
- ✅ Added BuffDebuffIcons to `party_frames.dart` — LEFT of each ally frame (12px icons)
- ✅ Extended `_buildBuffIndicators()` in `minion_frames.dart` — shows active effects from new system alongside existing DMG+/DMG-/DEF indicators
- ✅ Exported `buff_debuff_icons.dart` from `unit_frames.dart` barrel file
- ✅ Build verified clean (`flutter build web`)

#### Add Category Filter to Abilities Codex
- ✅ Added `_enabledCategories` set and `_filterExpanded` toggle state to `_AbilitiesModalState`
- ✅ Added `_getAllCategories()` helper — collects built-in categories from `AbilityRegistry.categories` + custom categories from `globalCustomAbilityManager` + custom options from `globalCustomOptionsManager`
- ✅ Built `_buildCategoryFilter()` — non-scrolling filter bar between header and content with: category count indicator, All/None quick-toggle buttons, expand/collapse toggle
- ✅ Built `_buildFilterChip()` — tappable checkbox chips colored by `_getCategoryColor()`, toggling category in `_enabledCategories`
- ✅ Applied filtering to "CURRENTLY ASSIGNED ABILITIES" — hides player/monster/ally sub-sections when unchecked, hides entire section header when all 3 disabled
- ✅ Applied filtering to "POTENTIAL FUTURE ABILITIES" — skips categories not in `_enabledCategories`
- ✅ Applied filtering to `_buildCustomCategorySections()` — skips custom categories not enabled
- ✅ Build verified clean (`flutter build web`)

#### Fix Custom Ability Double-Click Editing in Abilities Codex
- ✅ Added `ValueKey` to `AbilityEditorPanel` in `abilities_modal.dart` — key based on ability name + isCreatingNew flag forces Flutter to recreate panel state when switching between abilities
- ✅ Fixed `didUpdateWidget` in `ability_editor_panel.dart` — now also checks `isNewAbility` flag changes, not just ability name changes, ensuring fields repopulate when switching between override mode and full-save mode
- ✅ Added `behavior: HitTestBehavior.opaque` to custom ability card `GestureDetector` — ensures double-tap gesture registers across the full card bounds
- ✅ Build verified clean (`flutter build web`)

#### Fix Macro Execution + Combat Log Tab
- ✅ Made `getCooldownForSlot` public in `ability_system.dart` — renamed from `_getCooldownForSlot`, updated internal call site
- ✅ Added pre-checks in `macro_system.dart` `_executeAbilityForCharacter()` — checks cooldown, casting/winding up, and mana cost before calling `executeSlotAbility()`; macro now waits and retries on next frame when ability would fail instead of unconditionally advancing
- ✅ Created `lib/models/combat_log_entry.dart` — `CombatLogType` enum (damage/heal/buff/debuff/death/ability), `CombatLogEntry` class with source, action, type, amount, target, timestamp, formatted time
- ✅ Added `combatLogMessages` list to `game_state.dart`, updated `chatPanelActiveTab` comment to include tab 2
- ✅ Added `_logCombat()` helper to `combat_system.dart` — logs damage events from `checkAndApplyDamage()` with target type resolution, caps at 200 entries
- ✅ Added `_logHeal()` helper to `ability_system.dart` — logs heal events from `_executeHeal()`, `_executeGenericHeal()`, and `_executeGreaterHealEffect()`
- ✅ Created `lib/game3d/ui/combat_log_tab.dart` — `CombatLogTab` widget modeled after `RaidChatTab`, color-coded entries (red=damage, green=heal, yellow=buff, purple=debuff), monospace timestamps, scrollable list
- ✅ Added 3rd "Combat" tab to `chat_panel.dart` — red color scheme (0xFFCC3333), menu_book icon, border color tri-state, tab content routing
- ✅ Wired `combatLogMessages` prop through `game3d_widget.dart` → `ChatPanel`
- ✅ Build verified clean (`flutter build web`)

#### Macro Builder Fix: Ability Execution + Character Name Display
- ✅ Fixed `AbilityRegistry.findByName()` — now searches `PlayerAbilities` (Sword, Fireball, Heal, Dash Attack) first, then potentialAbilities; previously returned null for all Player abilities, silently killing macro execution
- ✅ Fixed `_executeAbilityForCharacter()` — uses `globalActionBarConfigManager.getConfig(characterIndex)` (target character's config) instead of `globalActionBarConfig` (active character's config); prevents wrong-config lookup when active character differs from macro target
- ✅ Restructured macro execution: active character path uses full AbilitySystem (animations/projectiles), non-active allies use direct cooldown+mana, non-active Warchief logs clear error
- ✅ Fixed macro step dropdown — includes `PlayerAbilities.all` so Sword, Fireball, Heal, Dash Attack appear in the ability selector
- ✅ Updated `MacroExecution.getCharacterName()` — matches Character Panel format: `'Warchief · Lv10 Warrior · "The Commander"'`, `'Ally N · LvX Class · "Title"'`
- ✅ Updated macro builder panel `_charName` and running indicator — displays full character identity instead of generic "this character"
- ✅ Build verified clean (`flutter build web`)

#### Spell Rotation & Macro System — Phase 3: Macro Builder UI Panel
- ✅ Added `macroPanelOpen` bool to `game_state.dart` UI STATE section
- ✅ Added `isRunningOnCharacter(int)` static method to `MacroSystem` for UI play/stop state
- ✅ Created `lib/game3d/ui/macro_step_list.dart` (~340 lines) — extracted step list + add-step form widget with numbered step cards, reorder/delete, inline add form with action type dropdown, ability selector, wait duration, condition dropdown
- ✅ Created `lib/game3d/ui/macro_builder_panel.dart` (~450 lines) — main draggable panel with list view (saved macros, play/stop/edit/delete, active indicator) and editor view (name field, loop toggle, step list, save/cancel)
- ✅ Wired R key handler in `game3d_widget.dart` — toggles `macroPanelOpen`, respects `_isVisible('rotation_builder')`
- ✅ Wired Escape handler — closes macro panel before chat panel in priority chain
- ✅ Wired `MacroBuilderPanel` into build Stack before ChatPanel with `_isVisible()` guard
- ✅ Updated `rotation_builder` in `interface_config.dart` — added `shortcutKey: 'R'`, updated description
- ✅ All new files under 500 lines (macro_step_list: ~340, macro_builder_panel: ~450)
- ✅ Build verified clean (`flutter build web`)

- ✅ Replaced all `gameState.playerHealth` → `gameState.activeHealth` and `playerMaxHealth` → `activeMaxHealth`
- ✅ Fixed Silent Mind: `whiteMana = maxWhiteMana` → `activeWhiteMana = activeMaxWhiteMana`
- ✅ All ~30+ ability methods now operate on the active character (Warchief or ally)
- ✅ Build verified clean (`flutter build web`)

#### Ability Aura Glow Effect System

  - Updated script to properly detect GAME_DIR before checking for pubspec.yaml
- ✅ Made Game3D widget const in main.dart
  - Prevents unnecessary widget recreation during parent rebuilds
  - Changed `Game3D()` to `const Game3D()`

## Notes

- Project uses **port 8008** (not 8888)
- Always use **uv** instead of pip for package management
- All new directories need CLAUDE.md with port 8008 requirement
- Create Pytest unit tests for all new features
- Never create files longer than 500 lines - refactor instead
- Use venv_linux for Python commands

## Discovered During Work

- Need to create config directory structure (config/game_config.json, config/ui_config.json)
- Need to create personalities directory for NPC personality files
- Should set up asset pipeline early (assets/ui/, assets/sprites/, etc.)
- Consider creating utility scripts for asset validation
- May need to create custom Flame components for isometric rendering
